Abstract
In recent decades, several meso-scale computational models 
have been developed for predicting the failure evolution and
strength of composite materials. Nevertheless, the complex 
failure mechanisms of composites pose a formidable challenge
to the development of models capable of consistently repro-
ducing its mechanical response under different loading case 
scenarios. Furthermore, the lack of standardised multiaxial 
tests has hindered consensus on failure envelopes and crite-
ria for composites. In this thesis, a new 3D elastoplastic 
damage model is then proposed to predict the plastic defor-
mation and the progressive failure of unidirectional lami-
nated composite materials at the meso-scale level.

A new plastic yield function and a new non-associative flow
rule are proposed to properly define the evolution of the 
plastic strains. The transverse plastic Poisson's ratio and 
the volumetric plastic strains can be then imposed. The 
proposed model is developed under the continuum damage me-
chanics and the thermodynamics of irreversible process 
framework. The damage evolution laws are defined to account
for the failure mechanisms on both longitudinal and trans-
verse directions. The plastic yield function and the fail-
ure criteria can be adjusted by setting two and six input 
model parameters (envelope shape coefficients), respectively,
to account for the mechanical behaviour of the material being
analysed.

Guidelines are provided on how to characterise the input ma-
terial parameters of the proposed model. In this line, a new 
methodology to measure the transverse Poisson's ratios in fi-
bre-reinforced polymer composite materials is developed. Trans-
verse tensile and transverse compressive standardised tests 
are instrumented using digital image correlation equipment to 
measure the strain field on the through-the-thickness surface 
of the specimens. A thermoplastic-based composite material is 
used to describe the proposed methodology. The elastic trans-
verse Poisson's ratio exhibits a different behaviour in tension 
than in compression, its value being greater in compression 
than in tension. Assuming no plastic strain in the longitudinal 
direction, the plastic transverse Poisson's ratio in compression 
suggests no volumetric plastic strains for small axial plastic 
strains. However, plastic dilatancy is observed when the amount 
of compressive plastic axial strain increases.

The capabilities of the constitutive model to predict the 
mechanical response of carbon fibre-reinforcement polymer 
laminates under complex loading conditions is demonstrated 
by performing several numerical-experimental comparisons. 
Apart from the accurate predictions in the off-axis and open-
hole tests, there is good agreement between the numerical results 
and the experimental data in end-notched flexural test, four-
point bending tests using L-shaped specimens and single-lap shear 
composite bolted joint tests. These tests have been analysed 
because they are tests in which the non-uniform out-of-plane 
stress states are developed, and they are challenging problems 
due to the combination of different failure mechanisms.

The constitutive model is extended to account for the viscous 
effects due to dynamic loading conditions. A novel 3D viscoelastic-
viscoplastic and viscodamage constitutive model is proposed. The 
viscoelastic response is modelled using the generalised Maxwell 
model and an overstress model is employed to address the visco-
plastic strain. The onset of viscodamage mechanisms is based on 
experimental expressions, and their propagation is considered to 
ensure the correct dissipation of the corresponding energy. The 
mechanical response of the present constitutive model under pure 
longitudinal shear loading conditions at different strain rates 
is presented. The higher the strain rate is, the stiffer the res-
ponse in the viscoelastic and viscoplastic region is. Additionally, 
the onset of viscodamage increases with high strain rate. Off-axis 
compressive experimental data at two different strain rates are 
employed to demonstrate the capabilities of the present model, 
and good predictions are obtained.
